# A crash course in genomic ranges and coordinate systems
*coordiante systems* arte used to desribe locations in a genome, described as a *range* on a linear choromosome sequence

*ranges* - integer intervals that represent a subsequence of consecutive positions on a (chromosome) sequence
- only specify a region

*genomic range* (*genomic interval*) consist of 3 parts: chromosome name, range, strand
- **Chromosome Name (or sequence name)**
	- no standard, some state as "chr#", "#", "chrX", "Y", "MT" (mitochondrion), "HE#"" (scaffolds), "scaffold_#" (scaffolds)
- **Range**
	- specify a single subsequence on a chromosome region; composed of a start and end position
- **Strand**
	- forward (+) or reverse(-) DNA strand

## Range
Ranges specified in a reference genomes are **version specific**, new reference genome version can change the ranges

Ranges are read based on the 5'-3' sequence: 
- forward(+) strands are read based on the "top" foward strand left to right
- reverse(-) strands are read based on the "bottom" reverse strand, right to left

There are 2 types of range systems in bioinformatics:
- *0-based* coordinate systems with *half closed, half open intervals*
  - first base in a sequence is at position 0, the last base's position = the legnth of the sequence - 1
  - half closed half open written "[start, end)"
		- brakets: indicates that a position is  *included* in the range (also known as "closed on this end")
		- parenthesis: indicates that a position is *excluded* in the range (interval is "open on this end")
- *1-based* coordinate systems with *closed intervals*
	- first base in sequence is at position 1, the last base's position = length of the sequence
	- closed intervals written "[start, stop]"
	
*range width* - the number of bases a range spans; calculated based on 0- o 1-base
- 0-base: 'end - start'
	- Note: 0-base systems allow for widths of 0
	- Useful for representing features "between" bases (i.e. restriction enzyme cut sights)
- 1-base" 'end - start + 1'
	- Note: 1-base systems lowest possible width is 1
	
Range of common bioinformatic formats
- BED: 0-based
- GTF: 1-based
- GFF: 1-based
- SAM: 1-based
- BAM: 0-based
- BLAST: 1-based
- GenomicRanges: 1-based
- Genebank/EMBL Feature Tables: 1-based

## Strand
Most range formats (except BLAST) specify range coordinates *on the forward strand* of the reference sequence 
- mRNA transcripts for forward strand read same as the reference sequence
- mRNA transcripts for reverse strand read same as the REVERSE COMPLEMENT to the reference sequence

Strand matters in RNAseq aligned reads

# An interactive introduction to range data with GenomicRanges
## Installing and working with Bioconductor packages
*bioconductor* - an open sorce software project that creates R bioinformatics packages and serves as as repository for them.  Common packages:
- GenomicRanges: used to represent and work with genomic ranges
- GenomicFeatures: used to represent and work with ranges that represent gene models and other features of a genome (genes, exons, UTRs, transcripts etc)
- Biostrings and BSgenome: used for manipulating sequence data in R
- rtracklayer: used for reading in comnmon bioinformatic formats (BED, GTF/GFF)

Bioconductor packages are installed using 'biocLite()' function
```{installing bioconductor}
# installing bioconductor
if (!require("BiocManager", quietly = TRUE))
  install.packages("BiocManager")
BiocManager::install(version = "3.14")
# install core packages
if (!require("BiocManager", quietly = TRUE))
  install.packages("BiocManager")
BiocManager::install()
# install specific package
BiocManager::install("AnnotationDbi")
# install multiple packages at once
BiocManager::install(c("GenomicFeatures", "GenomicRanges", "GenomicFeatures", "Biostrings", "BSgenome", "rtracklayer"))
```
## Storing generic ranges with IRanges
IRange is package that creates 'IRange objects' with two basic (start, end)
```{loading IRanges and creating an object}
> library(IRanges)
# creating ranges by specifying start and end
> rng <- IRanges(start=4,end=13)

# create ranges by specifying width with start or end position
> IRanges(start=4,width=3)
> IRanges(end=5,width=5)

# using vectors to generate multiple ranges
> x<-IRanges(start=c(4,7,2,20), end=c(13,7,5,23))

# start, end and width positions can be called 
> start(x)
> end(x)
> width(x)
> range(x)
# positions can be reset with the <- operator
> end(x) <-end(x)+4
# range information can be subset
> x[2:3]
> x[start(x) < 5]
> x[width(x) > 8]
> x['a']
# ranges can be merged
> a<-IRanges(start=7,width=4)
> b<-IRanges(start=2,end=5)
> c(a,b)
```

## Basic range operations: arithmetic transformations and set operations
IRange objects can be airithmeticaly transformed 
- "+", "-" and * for multiplication

Growing/adding to a range useful for creating buffer regions 
```{adding up and down stream regions to range}
> x<-IRange(start=c(40,80),end=c(67,114))
> x+4L
> x-10L
```

Multiplying by a positive integer "zooms in" (making a range narrower).  
Multiplying by a negative integer "zooms out" (making a range wider).  

You can restrict ranges to within a cetain bound
```{restricting range}
> y<-IRanges(start=c(4,6,10,12), width=13)
> y
> restrict(y,5,10)
```

You can obtain info on sequences outside of a set bound (flanking) to view up stream 
```{flanking ranges}
# upstream flanking
> x 
> flank(x,width=7) # by default, 'flank()' creates ranges of spedified width positions upstream of the specified ranges
> flank(x,width=7, start=FALSE) # finds downstream flank
```

Reducing regions to convert overlapping ranges into a signle range covering sequences within that total range.  Useful when 
```{reducing a range}
> set.seed(0) # set the random number generator seed
> alns<-IRanges(start=sample(seq_len(50,20), width=5))
> head(alns,4)
```

Gaps function returns the gaps between reduced ranges
```{gaps function}
> gaps(alns)
```
Other comparisons:
- 'intersect(a,b)' - shows only the part of ranges that overlap
- 'setdiff(a,b)' - shows portion of  'a' that isn't intersect with 'b'
- 'setdiff(b,a)' - shows portion of  'b' that isn't intersect with 'a'

## Run length encloding and views

## Storing genomic ranges with GenomicRanges
GenomicRanges extends IRanges
- IRange object basics apply to GRange objects
	- IRange objects: used to store ranges of genomic regions on a single sequence
	- GRange objects: same as IRange but includes sequence name (chr) and strand information
- GRange objects also contain metadata columns (holds data linked to each genomnic range)

Creating GRange objects:
```{loading GenomicRanges and creating GRange objects}
> library(GenomicRanges)
> gr<-GRanges(seqname=c("chr1", "chr1", "chr2", "chr3"), ranges=IRanges(start=5:8, width=10),strand=c("+", "-", "-", "+"))
```

## Grouping data with GRangesList

## Working with Annotation Data: GenomnicFeatures and rtracklayer
... (skipped ahead) ...

'rtracklayer' package includes functions for im/exporting range data from common format (GTF/GFF,BED,BED Graph)
- converts to 'GRanges' objects, handles technicalities (ex missing values, assigning columns in the f ile to metadata columns)
